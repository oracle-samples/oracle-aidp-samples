# Agent Flows Samples 

We provided a collection of agent flows spanning different use cases and industries. We included step-by-step instructions for agent flows built in the visual flow experience (visual-flow/) as well as agent flows built through the code-first (code-first/) experience. 

For the code samples, beware that you will need to provide your own OCI tenancy relevant information in the Python files. These parameters are highlighted throughout the code. Additional instructions to set the entry file and the dependency files are also provided whenever necessary.
