Outage Triage & Restoration Prioritization (Internal Playbook)
Version: 1.3  | Owner: Grid Ops Excellence

Purpose
- Provide a consistent way to prioritize restoration work during storms, equipment failures, or planned switching.
- Balance public safety, critical infrastructure impact, and restoration efficiency.

Definitions
- Critical Load: Facilities requiring priority restoration (e.g., hospitals, water treatment, emergency services).
- Feeder: A distribution circuit serving multiple laterals/transformers.
- ETR: Estimated Time of Restoration, updated at least every 60 minutes during major events.
- Hazard Condition: Downed conductor, pole on fire, energized equipment accessible to public, gas odor, etc.

Priority Order (Highest to Lowest)
1) Immediate Public Safety Hazards
   - Downed wires, arcing, fire risk, suspected energized contact.
   - Dispatch: Treat as “Make Safe” first, restore later if needed.
2) Critical Infrastructure
   - Hospitals/clinics, 911 dispatch, fire stations, water/wastewater plants, shelters.
   - If multiple critical sites exist, prioritize those with no backup generation or limited runtime.
3) Largest Customer Impact / High Load
   - Highest customer count or MW restored per crew-hour.
   - Prefer switching that restores large blocks without introducing new hazards.
4) Secondary Criticality (Community Services)
   - Schools (during severe cold/heat), large apartment complexes, commercial districts.
5) Individual/Small Outages
   - Laterals, single transformers, or isolated taps.

Operational Guardrails
- Never energize a circuit unless it is confirmed clear of hazards and switching order is approved.
- Use “two-step verification” for remote switching: operator reads back device ID and desired state.
- Update ETR when a new constraint is discovered (access, trees, material shortage, safety hold).
