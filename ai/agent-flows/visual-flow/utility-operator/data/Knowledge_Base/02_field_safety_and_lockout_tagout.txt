Field Safety: LOTO & Energization Rules (Excerpt)
Version: 2.1 | Owner: Safety & Compliance

Golden Rules
- Assume all conductors are energized until tested and grounded.
- Wear required PPE: arc-rated clothing, gloves, face shield, and hearing protection per hazard assessment.
- Establish job briefing before work begins and whenever conditions change.

Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Basics
1) Identify all sources of energy (including backfeed from DER).
2) Open and isolate switching devices per approved switching order.
3) Apply tags and locks; record device IDs and time.
4) Test for absence of voltage.
5) Apply protective grounds where required.
6) Release to work group; maintain boundary control.

Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Considerations
- Solar + storage can backfeed into an isolated segment.
- Confirm DER disconnection or anti-islanding status before proceeding.
- For known DER areas, require additional verification step: “DER check completed” in the switching order.

Re-energization Checklist
- All personnel accounted for, grounds removed, barriers cleared.
- Switching order reviewed and read-back completed.
- Notify control center before final close.
