Vegetation Management: Risk Scoring Guidelines
Version: 1.0 | Owner: Asset Health & Reliability

Why it matters
- Vegetation contact is a leading cause of sustained outages and momentary interruptions on overhead circuits.

Risk Score Components (0–100)
A) Clearance (0–40)
- < 2 ft clearance: 40
- 2–4 ft: 25
- 4–6 ft: 10
- > 6 ft: 0

B) Species & Growth Rate (0–20)
- Fast-growing (e.g., willow/poplar): 20
- Moderate: 10
- Slow: 5

C) Circuit Criticality (0–25)
- Serves critical loads or high customer density: 25
- Mixed residential/commercial: 15
- Low density: 5

D) Weather Exposure (0–15)
- High wind corridor / coastal / frequent icing: 15
- Moderate: 8
- Low: 3

Recommended Actions
- Score >= 70: schedule trim within 30 days (priority)
- 50–69: schedule trim within 90 days
- 30–49: monitor, trim in next cycle
- < 30: routine cycle
