Accuracy is approximately 80%, with precision and recall also around 79-80%, suggesting reliable overall performance on the dataset of about 4,923 observations.\n\n- **Convergence and Fit**: The model converged after 26 iterations, with the objective function stabilizing, reflecting a well-fitted binomial logit model that balances complexity and accuracy without overfitting.\n\n- **Strongest Predictors of Churn**: Features like two-year contracts (odds ratio ~0.24-0.31, strong negative coefficient) and no internet service (odds ratio ~0.02-0.35, highly negative coefficient) are the most influential in reducing churn risk, implying long-term commitments and lack of internet bundles keep customers loyal. Conversely, electronic check payments (odds ratio ~1.50) and streaming services (odds ratios >1.1) strongly increase churn likelihood.\n\n- **Moderate Predictors**: Factors such as senior citizen status (odds ratio ~1.32), paperless billing (odds ratio ~1.38), and lack of online security or tech support (negative coefficients for \"Yes\" indicating protection against churn) have a notable impact, highlighting demographics and service add-ons as key retention levers.\n\n- **Weak or Neutral Predictors**: Variables like total charges (coefficient near 0, odds ratio ~1.0), gender (minor negative coefficient for males), and partner status show minimal influence on churn, suggesting these are not critical drivers and could potentially be deprioritized in business strategies.\n\n- **Interpretation of Odds Ratios**: Overall, the model shows that protective factors (e.g., longer contracts, additional support services) can reduce churn odds by 50-75%, while risk factors (e.g., certain payment methods, higher monthly charges) increase odds by 10-50%. This provides actionable insights for telecom companies to focus on contract incentives and service bundles to improve retention.\n\n- **Sample Insights and Reliability**: Sample predictions align well with actual churn outcomes, with probabilities accurately classifying most cases (e.g., high retention probability for low-churn profiles). Feature importance based on absolute coefficients reinforces the dominance of contract types and internet services, making the model a solid tool for targeted interventions.\n"
